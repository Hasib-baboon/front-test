  That is a hard question to answer. But, in this universe, it is possible to find any answer, so long as you are willing to seek it. I have found, throughout my travels in this universe that the best answer to this question is this:

  we are here to love one another. To come together and to care for each other, be it as friends, or something even closer. For, that is what the name Yua means. It means love and affection. It means more than anything else someone could ever live for.I am just one Yua of many. This universe is young, but it is thriving. New planets blossom from the slurry of rocks floating through the blackness of space. Stars burst to life from violent nebulae, showering the darkness with colors that are indescribable. It is vibrant. There are so many places to explore, and I am excited to hear that you want to join me on this incredible adventure to discover why we are here, and which answer to the big question is the one that means the most.

  Could it be that the Yua of Miho, the closest to this solar system’s sun, have figured it out? The
  Yua are devils on this world. Not evil or vile, as you’re probably used to. They are simply wild.
  Darkness affects them greatly, so they prefer to be near the sun. Here, passions burn as hot as the
  solar flares that erupt from the molten surface of the yellow star. Molten rivers of lava flow over
  the surface, bathing the Yua settlements with heat and light. Few Yua live here because few can
  handle the heat, the intensity, that comes with the core energy that radiates through this world.
  Passion may be the base of love, but it is also the most volatile, the least controllable. This wild
  world is a dangerous one to delve into. Is it worth the risk for you?
  Or perhaps, the answers we want are on Nushiro, with its twin moons that orbit the blue orb like
  lovers on a dance floor. Humans inhabit this world, which is a green and blue paradise. As the
  moons spin, they churn the waters of this world, creating waves and tides that push and pull with
  unimaginable force. Strong Yuas live here. Ones who can handle the ever-changing currents of
  love and affection. The core energy of this planet is love’s unbelievable ability to adapt and to
  change. It is not as risky as the first planet, but it is an incredible one to see. Will the towering
  waves consume you? Can you handle the ebb and flow of love as one can the changing tides?
  Remmu is our most inhabited planet. It is the center of the Yuaverse. The main spot for all
  seeking questions and answers, friendship and camaraderie, and perhaps more. Angels inhabit
  this world, and guard the precious metals and gems that are embedded within its core. The
  surface is a sprawling city, filled to the brim with all manner of different sights and sounds.There are levels to this world, with the peak being towering skyscrapers that knife through the
  clouds and claw at the atmosphere. The depths are deep pits that sparkle with emeralds, rubies,
  diamonds, and sapphires, which have to be explored with caution and care. The core energy of
  this world is attraction, as that is the most common form of love. It has many different levels.
  Some attraction only lingers on the surface. A simple lust. Others run much deeper and are so
  much harder to navigate. Will you find your way? Or will you lose yourself in the tight
  alleyways of attraction?
  The final planet, Motoka, is the most mysterious, and the one we fellow Yuas are the most
  curious about. This one is a gas world that glows like a burning coal. Shadows roll over the
  surface as inky clouds blot out the burning, distant sun. Celestials guard this world, using it as
  their home as they balance the volatile forces of this young universe. It is the opposite of Miho.
  However, that does not mean it is devoid of the energy we seek, for even Love has its quiet
  moments. The core energy of this world is much harder to describe in a word. It is the gentle
  touch of hands, slipping away from each other as one lets go of another. It is a small nod of
  affirmation as one Yua leaves to achieve a dream, leaving the other behind. It is a sad love, but
  love nonetheless. The core of this world appears to be sacrifice. The ability to step aside, and let
  someone you love to thrive on their own. Perhaps there, we will find harsh answers, but answers
  nonetheless.
  Finally, in the blackness of space, lurks a force. It sits just beyond our sight and reach, waiting
  for the day our peaceful universe is sent into turmoil. The Celestials guard against it, but all of us
  Yuas are able to fight, and are ready and willing to defend our universe.
  As for me, well, I am Yua, and I will be your guide and friend in this universe. I have lived here
  for many years. I watched these planets form and saw them grow with more inhabitants that
  matched their varying environments. I have watched passions flare, love grow and shrink,
  attractions rise and fall, and ultimate sacrifices be made. I know quite a lot about this universe, so
  I hope you will listen to me along the journey.
  But, like you, I don’t know why I am here. That is why I will be tagging along with you. That is
  why I will be venturing into these planets by your side, soaring through the thin air or scouring
  the deep pits of Remmu, surfing the rolling lava rivers of Miho, diving into the mountainous
  waves of Nushiro, and braving the iciest chills of Motoka. I seek answers, like you.
  Why don’t you come with me and help me find them? After all, Love is many things. Our
  answers might be different, but it will be fascinating to discover nonetheless. In the meantime,
  we will build this universe together.
  Let’s go on an adventure now!`;
